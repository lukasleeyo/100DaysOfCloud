## Introduction

✍️ (Why) I have this contact me form on my portfolio website not working for a long time and I wanted to make it work.

## Prerequisite

✍️ (What) Since my portfolio website is hosted via S3 static hosting, I have to use serverless feature.

## Use Case

- ✍️ (Show-Me) Users can now submit contact me form and I will receive the email. 

## Cloud Research

- ✍️ Tried API gateway with HTTP API and it won't work because of CORS issue. Finally solved it with API Gateway REST API with CORS enabled.
-  Followed the following tutorial: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/create-dynamic-contact-forms-for-s3-static-websites-using-aws-lambda-amazon-api-gateway-and-amazon-ses/


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ (Result) Yay now my static s3 website works with sending email to myself without servers, embrace the serverless!

## Next Steps

✍️ Explore more serverless stuff.

## Social Proof

✍️ Show that you shared your process on Twitter or LinkedIn
