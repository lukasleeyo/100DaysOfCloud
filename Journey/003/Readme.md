## Introduction

✍️ On day 2 of 100 days cloud challenge, I managed to get my portfolio website's contact email form works. However, I was using my own work email to send to my own work email to receive message from viewers of my portfolio site. So I want to make use of Amazon SES to come out with a custom domain email. For example, my portfolio website domain name is example.com, the custom domain email I would prefer would be abc@example.com.

## Prerequisite

✍️ Since I am using Amazon SES's verified domain feature, I must use Route 53 for my portfolio website hosting which I already have done this.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ The outcome is I was able to get my custom email domain works.

## Next Steps

✍️ I will want to dive into development side of AWS so might take up AWS certified developer courses.
