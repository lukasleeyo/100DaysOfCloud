# Exploring Azure - Setting Budget Alerts

## Introduction

✍️ It's always good to set some sort of budget alerts to prevent shock of the cloud bills.

## Prerequisite

✍️ You need to have at least a pay-as-you-go subscription before you can create budget alerts. Free trial and Microsoft Imagine subscriptions cannot create budget alerts.


## Cloud Research

- ✍️ Clicking on "Cost alerts" to create the budget alert is the same as clicking on "Budgets" under the respective subscription.

- [Tutorial: Create and manage Azure budgets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-acm-create-budgets)


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

✍️ My bills will not overshot 10 bucks as I will stop the services when the budget alert triggered (90% of the 10 bucks threshold) and will notify me through email.

## What I have learnt
- What is the difference between a Budget Alert and a Credit Alert?
    - Budget alert is used for pay-as-you-go subscription whereas credit alert is used from enterprise level subscription such as Microsoft MSDN Azure subscription.
- What is the cost for creating Cost Alerts?
    - It's free to create cost alerts in MS Azure :D
- When a cost alert is triggered how will you know?
    - A cost alert will be triggered based on the threshold which is 9 dollars for me and it will notify me via email.
- Under what service in the Azure Portal do you find Cost Alerts?
    - Under the Subscriptions -> your_subscription -> Cost Management: your_subscription -> Budgets.
